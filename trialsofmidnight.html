			In Trials of Midnight, every level begins with the player selecting a number of minions that will assist them in battle. when we began designing the games combat system, we wanted to emulate the feeling of having a deck of cards that could be combined in different ways to inflict more damage on enemies. Each minion added to the players deck can either inflict direct damage on one enemy or use its special attack to spead out its damage to a number of enemies.

		<p class = "mt-3">
			The creative direction for Trials of Midnight was inspired by the duality of dreams and nightmares. As a team, we thought it would be interesting to create a roster of hostile and friendly units that conveyed certain triats of both types of dreams. This was how we settled on the concept of nightmares engaging in battles with dreams.v

		<p class = "mt-3">
			Our team was proud of the creative direction we chose for the games main themes and character designs. Some of our initial choices, such as chosing to make the players units look like enemies, caused some consfusion during play testing. To make up for this, we had to explicitly communicate the details of the story to the player through an intoductory cut scene. To address replayability and player investment, we also added an enemy encyclopedia which provided details and background information about the multitude of enemy and friendly units present in the game. Through weekly playtesting sessions we discovered that when combined, these design choices lead to players having a better understanding of the gameplay goals.
