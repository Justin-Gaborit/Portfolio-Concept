		<p>
		Tuber is a randomly generated endless runner for Windows PC. The world that the player runs through is a tube, and it spins as the player moves across different surfaces. The player can also jump to avoid obstacles and enemies that traverse the world in unique and challenging ways.

			All of the biomes featured in Tuber are built off of a random level generation system.
		</p>
		<img style = "width:120rem;" class = "img-fluid" src="elements/tuber/tuber_diagram.png">
		<p class = "mt-3">
			This diagram outlines how level generation is triggered during gameplay. It works like so:
		</p>
		<ol start="1">
  			<li>Player collides with level spawn trigger</li>
  			<li>Level spawn trigger executes a script that selects a level segment</li>
  			<li>New random level segment is instantiated and placed at spawn location</li>
  			<li>Collision trigger and spawn location are destroyed</li>
  			<li>Restart from step #1</li>
		</ol>
		<img style = "width:120rem;" class = "img-fluid" src="elements/tuber/collision_script.png">
		<p class = "mt-3">
			If we split the level generation system into two steps, the collision detection would be step #1.
			The code snipet above checks to see if a game object called "PlayerObject" (the player) has collided 
			with the trigger.
		</p>
		<img style = "width:120rem;" class = "img-fluid" src="elements/tuber/array_script.png">
		<p class = "mt-3">
			The code snipet bove, shows step #2 of the random generation system. 
			The array works by pulling a series of premade level segments from a folder called "resources".
			These level segments are then instantiated into the world.
		</p>

		<h5 class = "right">Player orientation</h5><hr class = "custom">
		<img style = "width:120rem;" class = "img-fluid" src="elements/tuber/orientation.gif">
		<p class = "mt-3">
			The player orientation is the second major limb of Tubers game design.
			The orientation system allows the player to stick to the the surface
			below them while navigating the game world.
		</p>
		<img style = "width:120rem;" class = "img-fluid" src="elements/tuber/orientation_script.png">
		<p class = "mt-3">
			First I establish a raycast and store the location and rotation information of
			point in space where it collides with the floor, this is called the "Hit Info".
			The rotation data from the hit info is then applied to the player characters rotation transfroms.
			This, combined with a downward force designed to mimic gravity, allows the player to stick to any surface
			they're standing on.
